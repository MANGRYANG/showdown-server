# Introduce project

<b>A combination of Western chess and Korean chess</b>

This is an ASCII-based board game that combines the mechanics of Western Chess and Korean Chess (Janggi).<br>
It aims to bring together the strategic depth of Chess and the unique gameplay elements of Janggi into a single, engaging experience.<br>


<b>Development of an ASCII-based game engine using C++</b>

The game engine for this project is being developed entirely in C++ to ensure optimal performance and full control over game mechanics.<br>
The CLI-based approach allows for a lightweight and accessible gameplay experience without relying on external graphical libraries.<br>


<b>Multiplayer Environment Setup</b>

This game enables real-time communication between players through a socket server, creating a multiplayer environment.<br>
This allows players on different devices to connect and enjoy the game together.<br>
